        <p>This bronze head, also known as the Ife Head, is one of eighteen copper alloy sculptures discovered in 1938 at Ife in Nigeria, the religious and former royal center of the Yoruba people. Believed to represent a king from the 14th or early 15th century, the Ife Head challenges Western conceptions of African art with its realism and sophisticated craftsmanship. Made using the lost wax technique, it is approximately three-quarters life-size, depicting a naturalistic face with a complex crown adorned with tube-shaped beads and tassels. The lifelike rendering is exceptional in Sub-Saharan African art.</p>

                The Ife Head was found accidentally during construction in 1938, and this discovery prompted the Nigerian government to control the export of antiquities. The head was taken to London in 1939 and is now housed in the British Museum. It is thought to be a portrait of a ruler, possibly King Obalufon Alayemore, patron deity of brass casters during a prosperous age for the Yoruba civilization.

                These bronze heads reflect trade connections, and Ife-made glass beads have been found widely in West Africa. The Ife sculptural tradition is part of West African artistic traditions, and the Ife Heads are considered a great achievement of African culture. Initially challenging Western understanding of African civilization, these statues now represent an indigenous African tradition that achieved a high level of realism and refinement.

                The influence of the Ife Head extends to contemporary culture, with its use in logos and branding for Nigerian corporations and educational institutions. It has been featured in exhibitions, including the 2010 Kingdom of Ife exhibition and the British Museum/BBC's A History of the World in 100 Objects. The head also symbolized the 1973 All-Africa Games in Lagos, showcasing its lasting impact on cultural representation.</p>
