        Welcome to Our Project
        <p>This project aims to showcase the rich history of African Americans through interactive 3D models and artifacts. Learn about the stories, struggles, and triumphs that have shaped black history.</p>
        <h3>Creating an engaging and educational space, our interactive museum is dedicated to the preservation and celebration of African heritage. This initiative stems from a profound recognition of the historical displacement and adversity faced by African communities. Uprooted from their ancestral homes and subjected to harsh environments, there has been a significant erosion of cultural identity and heritage. Our museum seeks to address this loss by spotlighting the rich tapestry of African cultures.</h3>

                        <p><strong>About Me:</strong> My name is Vijayvenkat Madapakula, I go by VJ. I've been dabbling in computer science for a little bit and I enjoy it a lot! I'm interested in the intersection between CyberSecurity and Artificial Intelligence, the two of the fields have a lot to offer and I'm interested to see how the two evolve overtime. I also like writing, reading and cooking in my free time. If you dislike (or like) my work, consider contacting me at vii.mjay@gmail.com! Enjoy!
