        <h5>Creating an engaging and educational space, our interactive museum is dedicated to the preservation and celebration of African heritage. This initiative stems from a profound recognition of the historical displacement and adversity faced by African communities. Uprooted from their ancestral homes and subjected to harsh environments, there has been a significant erosion of cultural identity and heritage. Our museum seeks to address this loss by spotlighting the rich tapestry of African cultures.
